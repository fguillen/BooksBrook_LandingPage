        #### Ok, how much does it really cost?

        if you subscribe to 2 graphic novels per month the cost will be 6€ each graphic novel. There is no extra cost. The costs of deliveries and maintenance are on us.

        #### Still confuse, give me an example of how much I will pay

        if you decide to read 2 graphic novels per month it will cost you 12€ per month. If you want to read 3 graphic novels per month the cost will be 16€ per month. If you want to read only 1 graphic novel per month the cost will be 8€ per
            month. See our [simple pricing model](./pricing.html)

        #### Am I saving any money?

        the price of purchasing any of these award winner graphic novels is of 25€ in average. So if you subscribe for 2 graphic novels per month you are effectively saving 38€ per month, as hard as it sounds.
